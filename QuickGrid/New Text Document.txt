Prompts
I am in Cairns in a Caravan. I am planning an itinerary for a road trip from Cairns to Brisbane. I want to limit each days travel to 300 klms maximum. There are 2 places I want to have a stayover and they are Airlie Beach and Yeppoon areas. Mostly I want to use free camps. Also they must be dog friendly.
